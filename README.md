# Ruby Solitaire by supergrok
solitaire entirely made with supergrok in RUBY. I did not look at the code. 
grok would output the code, i'd test it, I'd find bugs, suggest improvements, attach source code, send -> grok would output the code again repeat until it was done.
You can press backtick then type reset to reset the game.
